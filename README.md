🚀 Alex-Auto-Reply-Assistant 🤖
Hey there 👋 — this is a lightweight Node.js + Express server that uses OpenAI’s GPT to auto-generate polite replies.
Think of it as your little AI assistant that never forgets to say “Thanks, will get back to you!” (even if you already forgot).

✨ Features
POST endpoint at /auto-reply

Accepts:

json
Copy
Edit
{ "message": "your text here" }
Returns:

json
Copy
Edit
{ "reply": "AI-generated polite response" }
So if someone emails “Where’s my money bro?”, your app might save you from being rude. 💸

🛠 Tech Stack
⚡ Node.js + Express (server-side magic)

🧠 OpenAI API (GPT brain)

⚡ Thunder Client / Postman (for quick testing)

And get your fancy AI reply back. 🎩

🤓 Why I built this
My first pro AI project to showcase clean backend & API skills — plus how to use GPT in practical ways.
Also because typing “Sure, noted, thanks!” fifty times a day is basically a crime.

🧑‍💻 About me
Hi, I’m Alex, future AI engineer at Meta (or that’s the plan 😄).
I’m exploring how to make life easier with clever little automations.
Let’s connect on GitHub.

🌱 Next up
Add a front-end to let you paste emails and get replies instantly.

Maybe train it on my own style so it stops replying like a corporate robot 🤖.

⭐️ Wanna support?
Drop a ⭐️ on this repo. Or don’t.
But if you do, my polite AI will probably send you a thank-you note. 😉
